Pursuing my passion for technology, I'm currently in my first semester working towards a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. In these early stages, I'm building a strong foundation in computer programming, algorithms, data structures, and software development. My coursework is designed to provide me with essential skills to analyze intricate problems, devise efficient solutions, and develop robust software applications. Despite being in the initial phase, I've already had the opportunity to engage in various projects, collaborate with fellow students, and learn from experienced professors
